# Multi-agent-Reinforcement-learning-in-wireless-network-system


I implement Full-duplex Multi STAR-RIS with URLLC Service wireless network evironment. 

The main contribution is using Multi agent Reinforcement learning (MADDPG) for solving the target optimization problem.

This repository also contains Policy gradient algorithms such as DQN, Actor-Critic algorithms such as DDPG and TD3 and SAC.

The environment and optimization problem adopted from this paper:
